- Building Agentic AI orchestration workflows - leveraging Python based GPT powered agents to build distributed systems solving business processes and saving billions of dollars

- I coauthored a hot/cold storage system to solve data storage issues exceeding 4TB, that broke Azure's most premium storage tier
- I work with FinTech firms to create vertical agent solutions to optimize their credit rating strategies
